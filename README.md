## About

This repository collects small, focused Python examples grouped by topic and difficulty. Each example aims to:

- Teach a single concept or pattern.
- Be easy to read and run.
- Include short explanations and, when useful, alternatives or pitfalls.

Use it as a learning guide, teaching aid, quick reference, or a place to find clean snippets for projects and interviews.

## Highlights

- Beginner-friendly examples: variables, control flow, functions, data structures.
- Intermediate topics: OOP, modules, file I/O, exceptions, virtual environments.
- Advanced topics: decorators, generators, concurrency (asyncio, threading), typing, design patterns.
- Practical recipes: parsing CSV/JSON, HTTP requests, testing patterns, packaging basics.
- Clean, commented, and testable examples.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SahuShantanu/Python-Basic-to-Advanced-Examples.git
cd Python-Basic-to-Advanced-Examples
```

Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
python -m venv .venv
# macOS / Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
# Windows (PowerShell)
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

Install dependencies (if a section requires them). See each folder's README or the example file header for specifics.

## Repository Structure

Each folder groups related examples. A typical layout:

- basics/
  - variables.py
  - control_flow.py
- data_structures/
  - list_examples.py
  - dict_examples.py
- oop/
  - classes.py
  - inheritance.py
- advanced/
  - decorators.py
  - generators.py
  - asyncio_examples.py
- examples/
  - real_world_recipes/
- tests/
  - unit tests and usage examples

Files include short usage notes at the top and, where useful, a small demo block you can run.

## How to Use the Examples

- Open the example file and read the concise explanation at the top.
- Run it using `python path/to/example.py`.
- For interactive exploration, open the file in an editor or Jupyter Notebook and step through the code.
- If a file includes a `if __name__ == "__main__":` section, run it directly to see a demo.

## Best Practices & Coding Style

- Examples follow PEP 8 where practical.
- Use type hints for function signatures in intermediate/advanced examples.
- Prefer readable, expressive code over clever one-liners for teaching value.
- Tests are included where an example benefits from verification.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! To contribute:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/<topic>-example`
3. Add or update examples with:
   - Clear file header: purpose, Python version, dependencies.
   - Short usage/demo block.
   - Tests if appropriate (place under `tests/`).
4. Commit and open a pull request describing your change.

Please keep examples focused and well-documented. Small, atomic PRs are preferred.

## Support & Contact

For questions, suggestions, or help prioritizing topics, open an issue in the repository. If you'd like curated learning paths, mention which level (beginner, intermediate, advanced) and topics you're most interested in.

## License

If you have a preferred license, add a LICENSE file to the repository. If none is present, clarify licensing before using code in production.
